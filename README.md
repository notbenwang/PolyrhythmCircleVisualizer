# Polyrhythm Circle Visualizer

## Motivation
I was originally inspired by this video I encountered on Youtube (channel link: https://www.youtube.com/@LucidRhythms) and wanted to see if I could replicate the overall concept myself. I chose the language JavaScript because I wanted to gain a familiarity in the language.
I also wanted to make a program that was visually and audibly pleasing, and have aspects to make the simulation as "editable" as possible.

## How to Use
At the moment, the program isn't hosted on any server/web application, but you should be able to see the program by running the html as a live server through something like VSC. To change specific attributes of the simulation, use 'attributes.js.' 

## Future
In review, there was hindsight in that I developed the visualizer in that I learned JavaScript without linking it with learning a framework (like React), which practically would be a more useful exercise. 
Also, in terms of making the program visually and audibly pleasing, while I find it visually pleasing, I believe I took too much inspiration from the reference , and should have worked more to make it more visually my own. 
I also recorded the audio samples myself, and since the piano I used wasn't in tune, I can't say that the goal to make it audibly pleasing was met to the standards that I would've liked. I do believe however that the overall experience
working with html and audio recording softwares, and implementing audio files into a javascript application was a noteworthy skill.
